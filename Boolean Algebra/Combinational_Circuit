Decoder : takes n bit input and generates all possible 2^n output, one bit enabler to enable disable the circuit

Encoder : takes 2^n bits input and generates a n bit output, one bit enabler to enable disable the circuit

Multiplexer: takes 2^n bits input, and has n control lines, generates exactly one output

Demultiplexer: takes 1 input and has n control lines, generates 2^n output

If the input of demux is changed to be enabler, and control lines are changed to be input then it becomes decoder/
