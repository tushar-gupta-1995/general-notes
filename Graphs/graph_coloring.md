# Graph coloring:
the problem states that assign a color to very vertex of the graph such that no two adjacent vertex have the same color.

# Chromatic graph:
a graph colored(above problem) with min number of colors possible.

# Time complexity
this is a np complete problem. in other words the exponent is variable, that is with each vertex, the complexity increases exponentially, but once solved the solution can be verified easily.
A complete graph, should be the most expensive to color, since for each pair of vertices there is a unique edge.
Thus for a n vertices graph, each vertex is connected to n-1 vertices.
